# THE BISCUIT TIN

How often do we forget about all the shit we've been through? Shit is always there to be accomplished. 

THE BISCUIT TIN is a simple yet effective tool to get your arse in gear.
A BISCUIT is an accomplishment in your life (big or small) that you'd be proud to add to the BISCUIT TIN. Feel free to populate the TIN with your very own biscuits! Also feel free to PREPARE THE DOUGH with your current or future ''biscuits'' that you are working on. Think of this as your very own BISCUIT FACTORY! 

A Biscuit Tin is called a Cookie jar in the USA. 

David Goggins on the Cookie Jar - 
"What do you say to yourself when life is kicking your ass? When you keep failing at the things you truly want? This question was asked to me.
Once again this isnâ€™t for everybody.
I thank God for testing me again.
I go back to what I call the cookie jar.
The cookie jar is a place in my mind where I put all things bad and good that shaped me.
Some people try to forget the bad in their life.
I use my bad for strength when needed, great lessons learned.
In that cookie jar, I pull out whatever I need for the task at hand."
